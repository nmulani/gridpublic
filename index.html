	  <div class="row"><div class="col-md-1"></div><div class="col-md-10"><p>A combination of deteriorating electricity grid infrastructure and increasing severe weather incidents have resulted in a growing number of blackouts across the United States over the past fifteen years. According to data from non-profit public journalism initiative <a href="http://insideenergy.org/2014/08/18/data-explore-15-years-of-power-outages/">Inside Energy</a>, the five-year annual average of outages doubled every five years over the past fifteen years - from an average of 44 reported grid outages per year between 2000 and 2004 to an average of 200 reported grid outages per year between 2010 and 2013.</p><p>The chart below shows public data available for small to mid-sized blackouts across regions defined by the <a href="http://www.nerc.com/Pages/default.aspx">North American Electric Reliability Corporation</a>. A disproportionate amount of blackouts occur in south and southeastern portions of the U.S., where tropical storms and hurricanes are more common.</p></div></div>

	  <div class="row"><div class="col-md-1"></div><div class="col-md-10"><p>Most data about blackouts and grid failures travels by way of unstandardized processes from corporations and utilities to local governments, and then finally to the Department of Energy. Only 35 states mandate grid failure reportage. As a result, many of the entries for grid failures in the DoE database end up missing crucial bits of information, such as the cause of the blackout or number of people affected.</p><p>Other entities involved in the collection and management of data about electricity grids are the Independent System Operators or Regional Transmission Organizations (ISOs or RTOs), which organize <a href="http://www.isorto.org/about/Role">electricity markets</a> covering about two-thirds of the U.S. population and meeting about two-thirds of U.S. demand. Additionally, there are 107 balancing authorities which manage balancing supply and demand for power in specified areas. Depending on the area, the division of balancing authorities can be very complex. New York, New England and Texas are well-integrated and each only has one balancing authority. In contrast, Arkansas and Arizona have eight balancing authorities each, and Florida has eleven. This is not a reflection of system complexity or market demands, but merely of a convoluted history of grid development in the area.</p>

	  <div class="row"><div class="col-md-1"></div><div class="col-md-10"><p>Due to how most American grid infrastructure still dates back to the Kennedy administration, internal failure reporting processes are often documented in archaic formats. A lack of standardized, accurate data stands in the way of investment and innovation in numerous areas that could lead to preventing maintenance failures through predictive algorithms, as well as better integration with renewable energy sources.</p><p>In a <a href="http://web.mit.edu/seyda/www/Papers/Interfaces_AwardPaper.pdf">research project</a> led by Cynthia Rudin and Åžeyda Ertekin, a team of researchers from MIT and Columbia collaborated with ConEdison to get access to past grid failure data in order to determine predictive characteristics of grid failures and develop techniques to pre-empt future grid issues. They found it possible to use machine learning techniques such as the ROC curve to classify support tickets and predict future vulnerable areas of the electricity grid.</p><p>In the process, though, a large obstacle was the need to use a mix of handwritten and electronic maintenance tickets which were filled with unstandardized slang and abbreviations. The researchers note at the conclusion of their study that they "encourage companies (particularly companies with older equipment) to be careful how data are stored in anticipation of its potential future use." Much of the recent <a href="http://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/RR700/RR717/RAND_RR717.pdf">RAND report</a> on smart grid technologies is dedicated to discussing potential solutions to the problem of transmitting and managing electricity data, a few of which are explored below.

	  <div class="row"><div class="col-md-1"></div><div class="col-md-10"><p>One technique to help solve the problem of tracking and analyzing maintenance data is to equip the grid with smart meters and sensors, such as phasor measurement units, that can store and transmit data about weather conditions, damaged infrastructure, and grid failures. In order to track maintenance issues regardless of which parts of the grid are down, and to avoid the difficulties of centralized data tracking, mesh networking standards allow for each device to generate, store and transmit data in a flexible and efficient way, by relaying data in a redundant manner across the shortest available path. Decentralized mesh networking is listed as one of the most promising tools to enable smoother data communications across the grid in the recent <a href="http://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/RR700/RR717/RAND_RR717.pdf">RAND report</a>. </p><p> The Voronoi tessellation visualization method is <a href="http://www.ece.ncsu.edu/netwis/papers/13xw-TWC.pdf">used by researchers</a> to determine where to place grid sensors in order to effectively collect and transmit data on a mesh network. It shows all points nearer to a certain location than to any other point. The visualization below shows a possible distribution of sensors on an electricity grid.

By <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/belkin-energy-disaggregation-competition/visualization">combining</a> visualization techniques with statistical techniques such as Principal Components Analysis, engineers can separate out appliance-level data. If suppliers take advantage of the data to change how they distribute power on the grid and also incentivize consumers to respond to the data, it can result in load reduction on the entire grid, allow room for more integration with renewable energy sources and reduce outages.</p><p>The recent <a href="http://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/RR700/RR717/RAND_RR717.pdf">RAND report</a> on the potential of smart grid technologies mentions that effective visualization of appliance-level energy usage is crucial to motivate consumer behavioral change.

	  <div class="row"><div class="col-md-1"></div><div class="col-md-10"><p>The upgrading of electricity grids to handle large-scale data management and analysis also creates a host of new ethical challenges. Although data availability often makes decision-making easier, it also makes it simpler to <a href="http://spectrum.ieee.org/energy/the-smarter-grid/privacy-on-the-smart-grid">violate individual privacy</a> regarding household activities. It also becomes simpler to design systems and software that can create a deceptive view of how electricity is being distributed and consumed.</p><p>The recent <a href="http://www.ibtimes.com/volkswagen-emissions-scandal-what-defeat-device-how-does-it-work-why-cant-you-see-it-2112350">scandal</a> involving Volkswagen emissions software is only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the ability of engineers to create closed systems that handle data in ways that are difficult for regulators to understand or obtain access to.</p><p>The way that the "defeat device" software created by Volkswagen engineers functions gives a hint at what the future of software that enables data fraud looks like. The Volkswagen software observes data points such as the position of the steering wheel, vehicle speed, the duration of the engine's operation, and barometric pressure in order to determine whether the car was in testing conditions. If it is, the device activates emissions controls to cheat the test. Similarly, one can imagine consumers on the demand-side creating software that modifies appliance usage data before it is sent to the utility - or the utility faking maintenance or electricity usage data to meet regulator standards.</p></div></div>
